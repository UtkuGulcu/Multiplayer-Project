# Multiplayer-Project
This was a basic multiplayer game prototype heavily inspired from Gun Mayhem made in Unity. Unfortunately I had lost the project files, all I have about this project is this build. Because of that I can no longer make any updates to the game. Nevertheless I wanted to share it because it is kind of fun when you gather friends and try it.
  
I had been using Photon for networking while I was developing the project.
